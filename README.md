# Custom-Image-Manipulation
This repository contains some custom python code that has been used for a robotics project in which the robot had to detect some specific object inside an envirnoment and navigate towards or away from them.

The notebook contains some classe for the following tasks:
- Image Segmentation (implemented through K-means segmentation).
- Blob Detection (implemented through recursive and iterative exact methods but also an approximate algorithm).
- Image Pixelation (decrease an image definition by extracting the median color in a given area).
